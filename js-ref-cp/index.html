    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    // prints out 200, 100 age updates w/o updating age2
    // same for strings
    console.log(age, age2); 

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Mara';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
      // console.log(players); // updated
      // players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Mara']

    // now here is the problem!
    // WE DON"T WANT THAT!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // make an array copy
    const team2 = players.slice(); // COPY of players[]
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Mara'; 
    console.log(team2, team3, players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      // const team3 = [].concat(players); a COPY of team[]

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];// takes iterables & spread into new array
    team4[3] = 'Brainy';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a COPY instead?
    // Object.assign({empty_obj, array_to_fold, new_properties})
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 18, age: 33 });
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
